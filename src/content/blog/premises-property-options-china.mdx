Every company registered in China must have a legal business address, but the choice between a physical office and a virtual address can significantly impact your business operations, costs, and growth strategy. Understanding your options is crucial for making the right decision.

## The Legal Requirement

Chinese law mandates that every WFOE must have a registered business address (注册地址) that serves as:
- **Legal domicile** for official correspondence
- **Tax registration location** for local tax authorities
- **Business license address** for regulatory compliance
